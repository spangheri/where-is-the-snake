# Where is the Snake?

This project is integrated with Gabriel Spanghero Ph.D. thesis, which studies the Ecology and Evolution of Sleep in Snakes. This repository was created and inspired   on the https://github.com/MFErickson/findbutterfly repository. It contains the archives for the creation of the website https://spangheri.github.io/where-is-the-snake/. This game relies on the time people take to localize the snake against a similar background. We will use the data retrieved to  assess the efficiency of snake's camouflage during the period of inactivity or sleep.
